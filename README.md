# ICS4U CPT: Data Interaction and Visualization

### By: Gregory Lui and Stefan Tuczynski

The dataset being modelled in this JavaFX application is a Anime records list taken from the website [MyAnimeList.net](https://myanimelist.net/). (Reference to the dataset can be found at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marlesson/myanimelist-dataset-animes-profiles-reviews)). From this link, the file animes.csv is used in this project to model a personal anime list, similar to that of MyAnimeList. The data provided allows for a database of anime to be displayed with information about each anime entry shown on the list as well as extended information shown if a user clicks the anime. The main list of anime has a built in keyword search button, multiple sort types and a NSFW filter. A user can select which Animes they have watched and the Anime selected will be put into their own personal list. The Anime they selected will then contribute to a bar graph which shows the average user rating statistics of all they Anime they have watched as well as number statistics. Users will also see a pie chart that displays the proportions of genres they have watched.

We selected this data because as we believe that people should have an easy way to track which animes they have watched, not only to keep track of what they've watched, but also to see interesting data about themselves and how the internet sees the Animes the user has enjoyed. This data helped us create a meaningful program that can help someone looking for a way to track their watched Anime.
