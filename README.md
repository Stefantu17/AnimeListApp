# AnimeListApp

The dataset being modelled in this JavaFX application is a Anime records list taken from the website [MyAnimeList.net](https://myanimelist.net/). (Reference to the dataset can be found at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marlesson/myanimelist-dataset-animes-profiles-reviews)). From this link, the file animes.csv is used in this project to model a personal anime list, similar to that of MyAnimeList. The data provided allows for a database of anime to be displayed with information about each anime entry shown on the list as well as extended information shown if a user clicks the anime. The main list of anime has a built in keyword search button, multiple sort types and a NSFW filter. A user can select which Animes they have watched and the Anime selected will be put into their own personal list. The Anime they selected will then contribute to a bar graph which shows the average user rating statistics of all they Anime they have watched as well as number statistics. Users will also see a pie chart that displays the proportions of genres they have watched.

This project was initally mine and [Gregory Lui's](https://github.com/Gregory-Lui) grade 12 computer science final summative, this repository is the continuation of this project, enhanced with FXML to make a cleaner GUI.
